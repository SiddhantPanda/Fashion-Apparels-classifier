# Fashion-Apparels-classifier
This mini-project involves classifying various apparels by assigning some label after training the model using a neural network.
This is essentially a Computer Vision problem. Using the data from the 'train.csv', we'll train the model using a deep neural network in Tensorflow. After training the model, the model will be evaluated on the test set. The output will be a submission file.
